**How to Play:**

It's simple!! Each player takes a turn picking a box as either "X" or "O". Once someone gets 3 in a row, the game will stop allowing players to pick a box. Once the game is over, simply hit the "Try Again" button at the bottom of the page to start over. It also comes with a built in scoreboard for those who like to keep track.
